## Trivia Game

# Rules
In this game, there are 6 sets of trivia questions based off of movies. A timer will begin counting down when the start button is clicked. After submitting the form, a page with the results will be shown as well as numbers of unanswered questions. The same will happen when the timer hits 0. A reset button will reset the game.

# Design
The basic structure of the game is similar to a form. The questions are objects in an array to make scoring easier at the end. The scores are calculated by matching the same as the computers.

# Improvements
Other features that could be added is randomizing the set of questions each time the game is restarted.
